### About
<img src="./dezly_systems.gif" width="300" height="200" />

My systems are configured for the purpose of `ðŸ”§ Software Engineering` 
and `ðŸ•µ Ethical Hacking`.

I believe that the two are inseparable. Each one sharpens the skills in the 
other and gives a well-rounded perspective to the tech world.

### Primary Operating System: NixOS

- Declarative system configuration
- Easy to reproduce my setup on a new install of NixOS
- Consistency of development environment across NixOS systems
- Allows me to disable a specific setting or config module by turning it
into a comment
- Allows me to experiement with the latest software packages safely

**Software Engineering**

If you are `building` things, you should also be learning how to `secure` what
you have built from threat actors. I never want to be a software engineer who
just blindly copies and pastes code from tutorials and AI without having an
understanding of what that code is doing.
